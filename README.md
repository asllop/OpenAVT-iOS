## 1. Introduction

The Open Audio-Video Telemetry is a set of tools for performance monitoring in multimedia applications. The objectives are similar to those of the OpenTelemetry project, but specifically for sensing data from audio and video players. OpenAVT can be configured to generate Events, Metrics or a combination of both.

## 2. Installation

To install OpenAVT-iOS, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'OpenAVT-Core', :git => 'https://github.com/asllop/OpenAVT-iOS'
```

Besides the Core, the following modules are available:

#### 2.1 AVPlayer Tracker

Tracker for the AVPlayer video and audio player.

```ruby
pod 'OpenAVT-AVPlayer', :git => 'https://github.com/asllop/OpenAVT-iOS'
```

#### 2.2 Google IMA Tracker

Tracker for the Google IMA ads library.

```ruby
pod 'OpenAVT-IMA', :git => 'https://github.com/asllop/OpenAVT-iOS'
```

#### 2.3 Graphite Backend

Backend for the Graphite metrics database.

```ruby
pod 'OpenAVT-Graphite', :git => 'https://github.com/asllop/OpenAVT-iOS'
```

#### 2.4 InfluxDB Backend

Backend for the InfluxDB metrics database.

```ruby
pod 'OpenAVT-InfluxDB', :git => 'https://github.com/asllop/OpenAVT-iOS'
```

#### 2.5 New Relic Backend

Backend for the New Relic data ingestion service.

```ruby
pod 'OpenAVT-NewRelic', :git => 'https://github.com/asllop/OpenAVT-iOS'
```

## 3. Usage

There are many ways to use the OpenAVT library, depending on the use case, here we will cover the most common combinations. We won't explain all the possible arguments passed to the constructors, only the essential ones. For the rest check out the [documentation](#doc).

### 3.1 Choosing a Backend

The first step is chosing the backend where the data will be sent. We currenly support OOTB three different backends: Graphite, InfluxDB and New Relic. Let's see how to init them:

#### 3.1.1 Init the Graphite Backend

```swift
let backend = OAVTBackendGraphite(host: "192.168.99.100")
```

`host` is the address of the Graphite server.

#### 3.1.2 Init the InfluxDB Backend

```swift
let backend = OAVTBackendInfluxdb(url: URL(string: "http://192.168.99.100:8086/write?db=test")!)
```

`url` is the URL of the InfluxDB server used to write data to a particular database (in this case named `test`).

#### 3.1.3 Init the New Relic Backend

```swift
let backend = OAVTBackendNewrelic()
```

The New Relic Mobile Agent must be installed and setup to use this backend.

### 3.2 Choosing a Hub

Next we will choose a Hub. This element is used to obtain the data comming from the trackers and process it to pass the proper events to the backend. Users can implement their own logic for this and use their own custom hubs, but OpenAVT provides a default implementation that works for most cases.

For instruments with video tracker only, we will chose:

```swift
let hub = OAVTHubCore()
```

And for instruments with video and ads tracker:

```swift
let hub = OAVTHubCoreAds()
```

### 3.3 Choosing a Metricalc

This step is optional and only necessary if we want to generate metrics, if we only need events this section can be omitted. A Metricalc is something like a Hub but for metrics, it gets events and process them to generate metrics. Again, users can provide custom implementation, but the OpenAVT library provides a default one:

```swift
let metricalc = OAVTMetricalcCore()
```

### 3.4 Choosing Trackers

And finally, the trackers, the piece that actually generates the data. Currently OpenAVT provides two trackers: AVPlayer and Google IMA Ads. We won't cover how to setup the AVPlayer and IMA libraries, for this checkout the correspondig documentation or the [examples](#examp).

#### 3.4.1 Init the AVPlayer Tracker

```swift
let tracker = OAVTTrackerAVPlayer(player: avplayer)
```

Where `player` is an instance of the AVPlayer.

#### 3.4.2 Init the IMA Tracker

```swift
let adTracker = OAVTTrackerIMA()
```

### 3.5 Creating the Instrument

Once we have all the elements, the only step left is putting everything together:

```swift
let instrument = OAVTInstrument(hub: hub, metricalc: metricalc, backend: backend)
let trackerId = instrument.addTracker(tracker)
let adTrackerId = instrument.addTracker(adTracker)
instrument.ready()
```

Here we have created a new instrument that contains all the elements, and once all are present, we called `ready()` to initialize everything, This will cause the execution of the method `OAVTComponentProtocol.instrumentReady(...)` in all trackers, hub, metricalc and backend. Now the instrument is ready to start generating data.

NOTE: Should we put all this in a separate .md file?

## Advanced Topics

#### Custom Instrument Elements

OpenAVT provides a set of trackers, hubs, metricalcs and backends, that cover a wide range os possibilities, but not all. For this reason the most inetresting capability it offers is its flexibility to accept custom implementations of these elements.

TODO: explain how to create custom stuff.

#### Custom Events

#### Custom Attributes

#### Custom Metrics

#### Custom Trackers

#### Custom Hubs

#### Custom Metricalcs

#### Custom Backends

#### Custom Buffers
